Python programming class Assignment1 
Assignment 1 covers basics of Python programming. It includes two sets of problems. First one is basically about manipulating lists. List is the most versatile sequence type in Python. Unlike strings and dictionaries, list is mutable. We can store any type of data we like in a list. List is equiped with lots of functions that we can use to manipulate it. 

Second problem focuses on dictionaries. In other programming languages such as Java, Hash tables are the equivalents of dictionaries. They provide the means to include keys associated with each data we store in them so that instead of using only integers to locate the datas in the sequences, as is the case in the other data structures, we use the keys to access them for further manipulation.
